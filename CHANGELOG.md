and versions follow Semantic Versioning.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-15

First public release.

### Added

- Two queue modes: "This Mac only", where Relay keeps the queue itself and nothing
  leaves the Mac, and Mailbox, where Relay polls a mailbox service you run.
- The menu-bar app: a sidebar for open asks with Copy buttons, tickable steps, and
  Done, Skip and Reply; a red badge with the open count; a global shortcut; and
  Settings with General, Queue, Notifications and Connect tabs.
- Notifications by urgency, with an optional sound and a slide-in sidebar for "now"
  asks.
- The `relay` CLI: `post`, `status`, `list`, `done`, `skip`, `replies` and `wait`.
- An optional Claude Code hook that shows new owner answers in the next prompt.
- The MCP server (`relay_post`, `relay_status`, `relay_list`) and the
  `instructables` skill for Claude Code.
- An installer that builds the app, links the CLI and skill, registers the MCP
  server, and updates or uninstalls in place.
- Security hardening: a loopback-only API with a 256-bit token, refusal of browser
  requests, a server proof before any client sends the token, private file
  permissions, and secret-like strings rejected in asks.
